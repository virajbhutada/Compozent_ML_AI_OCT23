**TASK 1 (BASIC): Spam Email Classifier** 

Project Overview:
This project focuses on developing a spam email classifier using advanced machine learning techniques. The goal is to accurately identify spam emails and improve email filtering efficiency.

Steps Involved-

Data Loading and Exploration: Load the dataset and explore its structure. Understand the columns, features, and labels. Familiarize yourself with the dataset's format.

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values and prepare the data for training. Impute missing values using mean values for each feature.

Model Building: Implement a machine learning model using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm for text classification. Train the model using the preprocessed data.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Understand the model's performance in classifying emails as spam or not spam.

Interpretation of Results: Interpret the results obtained, focusing on the accuracy score. An accuracy of 0.95 indicates the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between spam and non-spam emails.
